They act as intermediaries between the user interface (view) and the data model, facilitating the flow of information and orchestrating the application's logic.</p> <p>Origins of MVC</p> <p>The concept of MVC (Model-View-Controller) originated in the realm of graphical user interfaces (GUIs). It emerged as a design pattern aiming to separate the different concerns of an application, namely the data model, the user interface, and the logic that connects them.</p> <p>Request-Response Cycle in Web Applications</p> <p>In the context of web applications, interactions between the client (user) and the server occur through a series of requests and responses. When a user interacts with a web page, such as clicking a link or submitting a form, the browser sends a request to the server. The server then processes the request, generates a response, and sends it back to the browser. This response typically contains the updated content or a new page to be displayed to the user.</p> <p>Grouping Actions: Controllers</p> <p>Controllers in web applications are responsible for handling specific actions or tasks. They receive requests from the user, process them, and determine the appropriate responses. For instance, in a gradebook application, the controller might handle actions such as adding a new student, assigning a student to a course, or updating a student's marks.</p> <p>CRUD Operations</p> <p>CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations are fundamental to many web applications. They represent the basic operations that can be performed on data stored in a database. Controllers often encapsulate these operations, providing methods for creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting data.</p> <p>Routes and Controllers</p> <p>Routes are patterns that define how incoming requests are mapped to specific controllers and actions. When a user accesses a particular URL, the web framework matches the URL to a predefined route and invokes the corresponding controller and action. This mechanism allows for a clean and organized way of handling different types of requests.</p> <p>Applicability of MVC in Web Development</p> <p>While MVC was initially conceived for GUI applications, it has also been adapted to the context of web development. However, certain aspects of MVC may not translate directly to the web due to differences in the nature of web applications. For instance, web applications often do not maintain the state of individual clients, and the separation between the view and the model may not be as distinct as in traditional GUI applications.</p> <p>Separation of Concerns</p> <p>Despite these differences, MVC remains a valuable conceptual framework for understanding the separation of concerns in web applications. By separating the data model, view, and controller, MVC promotes code organization and maintainability. It allows developers to focus on specific aspects of the application without getting entangled in the complexities of other components.</p> <p>Basic Learnings from MVC</p> <p>The basic principles of MVC can be applied to web development, including:</p> <ul> <li>Separation of concerns into model, view, and controller</li> <li>Use of controllers to handle user input and determine responses</li> <li>Use of routes to map requests to specific controllers and actions</li> <li>Application of CRUD operations to manage data</li> </ul> <p>Flexibility and Adaptability</p> <p>It is important to note that MVC should not be applied rigidly in web development. The specific implementation of MVC may vary depending on the application and framework being used. Developers should be prepared to adapt and extend the basic concepts of MVC to fit the unique requirements of their web applications.</p>"},{"location":"week%205/Week%205-23-34/","title":"Week 5-23-34.pdf (PDF file)","text":""},{"location":"week%205/Week%205-23-34/#week-5-23-34pdf-pdf-file","title":"Week 5-23-34.pdf (PDF file)","text":"<p>Summary CRUD Operations</p> <p>CRUD (Create-Read-Update-Delete) is a fundamental concept in database operations.

The client, typically a web browser, acts as the interface through which users interact with the web application, sending requests and receiving responses. On the other hand, the server, usually a remote computer, processes the client's requests, retrieves or generates the necessary data, and sends back responses to the client. This back-and-forth communication between the client and the server forms the backbone of web application interactions.</p> <p>Stateless Nature of Web Applications</p> <p>Web applications are inherently stateless, meaning that the server maintains no persistent knowledge or context about the client's previous requests or interactions. Each request is treated as an independent entity, devoid of any awareness of the client's history or state. This characteristic stems from the underlying HTTP protocol, which governs the communication between the client and the server, and is a fundamental design principle of web applications.</p> <p>To accommodate this stateless nature, web applications must be designed to respond to any client request without making assumptions about the client's state. Every request must contain all the necessary information for the server to process it effectively, ensuring that the server can handle each request independently.</p> <p>HTTP Protocol and Routing</p> <p>HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) serves as the primary communication protocol in web applications. It defines a set of request methods, known as HTTP verbs, such as GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, and others, each conveying a specific meaning or action. These verbs indicate the intended operation on the server-side, allowing the server to interpret the client's request and perform the appropriate actions.</p> <p>In addition to HTTP verbs, URLs (Uniform Resource Locators) play a crucial role in web applications. URLs provide a structured way to identify and locate resources on the server, such as web pages, images, or data. The server uses the URL to determine the specific resource requested by the client.</p> <p>Routing is a fundamental aspect of web applications, and it refers to the process of mapping incoming URLs to specific actions or functions on the server-side. This mapping enables the server to identify the appropriate code to execute based on the URL requested by the client. Routing plays a critical role in directing the flow of the application and determining the appropriate response to each client request.</p> <p>Python Decorators and Function Enhancements</p> <p>Python decorators offer a powerful mechanism to enhance and modify the behavior of functions without altering their original source code. They are prefixed with the \"@\" symbol and are placed above the function definition. Decorators essentially act as functions that take another function as an argument and return a new function that incorporates the added functionality.</p> <p>Decorators provide a flexible way to add pre- or post-processing logic to functions, extending their capabilities without the need for invasive code modifications. They enable developers to modify function behavior dynamically, inject additional functionality, or perform common tasks in a reusable and maintainable manner.</p> <p>Basic Routing in Flask</p> <p>Flask, a popular Python web framework, simplifies the process of routing URLs to specific functions within the application. The @app.route decorator is used to associate a URL with a particular function. When a client makes a request to the specified URL, Flask invokes the corresponding function, allowing the developer to handle the request and generate an appropriate response.</p> <p>For example, the following code defines a simple route in Flask that returns the string \"Hello World!\" when a client accesses the root URL (\"/\"):</p> <pre><code>from flask import Flask\n\napp = Flask(__name__)\n\n@app.route(\"/\")\ndef home():\n    return \"Hello World!\"\n</code></pre> <p>HTTP Verbs and Request Methods</p> <p>HTTP verbs, as mentioned earlier, play a significant role in routing and specifying the intended action on the server-side. Flask allows developers to specify the HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) that a particular route supports. This enables finer control over the types of requests that can be handled by a specific route.</p> <p>For instance, the following code defines two routes in Flask: one for handling GET requests to the root URL (\"/\") and another for handling POST requests to the \"/create\" URL:</p> <pre><code>from flask import Flask\n\napp = Flask(__name__)\n\n@app.route('/', methods=['GET'])\ndef index():\n    ...\n\n@app.route('/create', methods=['POST'])\ndef store():\n    ...\n</code></pre> <p>By specifying the allowed HTTP methods, Flask ensures that the appropriate function is invoked based on the method used in the client's request, providing greater flexibility and control over request handling.</p> <p>CRUD-Like Functionality with Flask</p> <p>CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations form the foundation of data manipulation in web applications. Flask provides a convenient way to implement CRUD-like functionality by combining routes and HTTP methods.</p> <p>The following code demonstrates how to implement CRUD-like functionality in Flask using decorators:</p> <pre><code>from flask import Flask\n\napp = Flask(__name__)\n\n# Assume 'index', 'store' etc are functions\n\n@app.route('/', methods=['GET'])(index)\n@app.route('/create', methods=['POST'])(store)\n@app.route('/&lt;int:user_id&gt;', methods=['GET'])(show)\n@app.route('/&lt;int:user_id&gt;/edit', methods=['POST'])(update)\n@app.route('/&lt;int:user_id&gt;', methods=['DELETE'])(destroy)\n</code></pre> <p>In this code, each decorator associates a specific HTTP method with a URL pattern and the corresponding function. For instance, the @app.route('/create', methods=['POST']) decorator maps the POST method to the \"/create\" URL and invokes the store function when a POST request is made to that URL. Similarly, other decorators handle GET, PUT, and DELETE requests for different URLs, providing a structured and consistent approach to CRUD operations.</p> <p>Summary and Key Concepts</p> <p>Flask, a widely used Python web framework, simplifies the development of web applications by providing a straightforward routing mechanism and support for various HTTP methods. It does not strictly adhere to the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern, but it encourages a separation of concerns and clean design practices.</p> <p>Routing in Flask involves mapping URLs to specific functions or actions on the server-side. This enables the application to handle incoming requests and generate appropriate responses based on the requested URL. HTTP verbs play a crucial role in routing, indicating the intended action (e.g., GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).</p> <p>Flask decorators offer a convenient way to enhance function behavior and implement common patterns, such as CRUD-like functionality. They allow developers to add pre- or post-processing logic, inject additional functionality, or perform common tasks in a reusable and maintainable manner.</p> <p>By understanding these concepts and utilizing the tools provided by Flask, developers can create robust and efficient web applications that handle user requests effectively and provide a seamless user experience.</p>"},{"location":"week1/Week%201_annotated/","title":"Week 1_annotated.pdf (PDF file)","text":""},{"location":"week1/Week%201_annotated/#week-1_annotatedpdf-pdf-file","title":"Week

<p>Computers operate solely on \"bits,\" which are binary digits with values of 0 or 1. Numbers can be represented using bit patterns, such as 6 being represented as 0110 in binary. Negative numbers can be represented using the two's complement notation, such as -6 being represented as 1010.</p> <p>Textual information presents a challenge as it consists of arbitrary characters. ASCII is a 7-bit encoding standard that defines codes for common characters such as letters, numbers, and special symbols. However, ASCII is limited to 128 different entities, making it insufficient for representing text in many languages that use non-Latin characters.</p> <p>Unicode and UTF-8</p> <p>Unicode is a character encoding standard that aims to provide codes for all living and historical languages. It uses UCS (Universal Character Set) encodings, such as UCS-2 (2 bytes per character) and UCS-4 (4 bytes per character), to accommodate a vast number of characters.</p> <p>UTF-8 is a variable-length encoding format for Unicode that uses 8-bit units. It is widely used on the web because it is efficient for representing common characters while also supporting a wide range of languages.</p> <p>Markup vs Style</p> <p>Markup languages like HTML focus on separating content from its presentation. HTML tags provide semantic meaning to the content, such as indicating a heading (</p><p>). On the other hand, style sheets like CSS are used to specify the visual presentation of the content, such as font size, color, and layout.</p> <p>HTML (HyperText Markup Language)</p> <p>HTML is the predominant markup language for the web. It allows content to be structured using tags, which can be nested to create complex documents. HTML5 introduced new tags and features, such as , , and , to enhance the semantic representation of content.</p> <p>Document Object Model (DOM)</p> <p>The DOM is a tree-like representation of an HTML document that allows developers to programmatically manipulate the content and structure of the document. Using the DOM, developers can add, remove, or modify elements and their attributes.</p> <p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)</p> <p>CSS is used to control the presentation of an HTML document. It allows developers to specify the visual appearance of different elements, such as font, color, size, and layout. CSS can be applied inline (within HTML elements), internally (within the </p> tag), or externally (in a separate style sheet). <p>Responsive Design</p> <p>Responsive design is an approach to web design that ensures the website adapts to different screen sizes and form factors, such as desktops, laptops, tablets, and smartphones. By using CSS media queries, developers can define different styles for different screen sizes, ensuring optimal user experience on all devices.</p> <p>Bootstrap</p> <p>Bootstrap is a popular CSS framework that provides pre-built styles and components for common web elements, such as buttons, forms, and navigation bars. It simplifies the development of responsive web designs by offering a consistent and mobile-first approach.</p> <p>JavaScript</p> <p>JavaScript is a scripting language that is integrated into the web browser. It allows developers to add interactivity and dynamic behavior to web pages, such as handling user input, manipulating the DOM, and creating animations. JavaScript is essential for enhancing the user experience on the web.</p>"},{"location":"week2/activity_session_/","title":"Activity session","text":""},{"location":"week2/activity_session_/#q1","title":"Q1","text":"<p>if we are using 8 bit ASCII each character is represented by 8 bits .</p> <p>doc has 8000 charcaters so  bits required is 8000* 8 bits = 64000 bits</p>"},{"location":"week2/activity_session_/#q2","title":"Q2","text":"<p>we have 11 character</p> <p>\\(2^3\\) = 3 bits = 8 combinations , we can represent 8 different characters</p> <p>As we have 11 charater we will need \\(2^4\\) = 4 bits = 16 character</p> <p>1 character = 4 bits , so n characters storage size = n * 4 bits</p> <p>no of characters = \\(\\\\displaystyle\\\\frac{size\\\\ of\\\\ file}{ bits\\\\ per\\\\ char}\\) = \\(\\\\displaystyle\\\\frac{2*1000*8}{4}\\)= 4000</p>"},{"location":"week2/activity_session_/#styling-precident","title":"Styling Precident","text":"<p>!important &gt; inline &gt; Internal &gt; External</p>"},{"location":"week2/activity_session_/#based-styling-precident","title":"based styling Precident","text":"<p>!important &gt; ID &gt; class &gt; Element</p>"},{"location":"week3/Accessibilty/","title":"Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI)","text":""},{"location":"week3/Accessibilty/#web-accessibility-initiative-wai","title":"Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI)","text":"<p>The W3C Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) outlines several core principles to make web content accessible to people with disabilities.

A more structured approach is required to efficiently represent and manage such relationships.</p> <p>Database Management Systems: A Structured Approach to Data Storage</p> <p>Database management systems (DBMS) provide a structured and efficient way to store and manage data, including support for relationships between data items. They offer features such as:</p> <ul> <li>Data Definition Language (DDL): Allows for the creation and modification of database structures, defining tables, columns, and relationships.</li> <li>Data Manipulation Language (DML): Enables the insertion, modification, and retrieval of data from the database.</li> <li>Structured Query Language (SQL): A widely used language for interacting with databases, allowing for complex queries and data manipulation operations.</li> </ul> <p>Key Concepts in Database Management</p> <ul> <li>Table: A collection of related data organized into rows and columns, where each row represents an individual record and each column represents a specific data attribute.</li> <li>Primary Key: A unique identifier that distinguishes each record in a table.</li> <li>Foreign Key: A column that references a primary key in another table, establishing a relationship between the two tables.</li> <li>Join: An operation that combines rows from two or more tables based on matching values in their foreign and primary keys.</li> </ul> <p>Benefits of Using a Database Management System</p> <ul> <li>Data Integrity: Enforces data integrity by ensuring data accuracy and consistency through constraints and validation rules.</li> <li>Data Redundancy Reduction: Eliminates duplicate data by storing related data in separate tables and linking them through relationships.</li> <li>Efficient Data Retrieval: Provides fast and efficient data retrieval through optimized indexing and query execution.</li> <li>Scalability: Supports large data volumes and can scale to handle increasing data requirements.</li> <li>Security: Offers features for user authentication, authorization, and data encryption to protect sensitive information.</li> </ul> <p>Database Models: Organizing Data Relationships</p> <p>Database models provide a framework for organizing and representing data relationships. Common database models include:</p> <ul> <li>Hierarchical Model: Organizes data in a tree-like structure, where each parent record can have multiple child records.</li> <li>Network Model: Similar to the hierarchical model, but allows for more complex relationships where a child record can have multiple parents.</li> <li>Relational Model: The most widely used model, organizes data into tables and uses foreign keys to establish relationships between tables.</li> <li>Object-Oriented Model: Models data as objects, encapsulating both data and behavior, and supports inheritance and polymorphism.</li> </ul> <p>Choosing the Right Database Model</p> <p>The choice of database model depends on the specific data structure and the requirements of the application. Relational databases are widely used for structured data with well-defined relationships, while object-oriented databases are more suitable for complex data structures and applications involving inheritance and polymorphism.</p> <p>Advantages and Disadvantages of Database Management Systems</p> <ul> <li>Advantages:</li> <li>Ensures data integrity and consistency</li> <li>Reduces data redundancy</li> <li>Facilitates efficient data retrieval</li> <li>Supports scalability and large data volumes</li> <li>Provides security features</li> <li>Disadvantages:</li> <li>Can be complex to design and implement</li> <li>Requires specialized knowledge and expertise</li> <li>May have performance limitations with very large data sets</li> <li>Can incur additional costs for licensing and maintenance</li> </ul> <p>Conclusion</p> <p>Persistent storage and database management systems are essential for managing data in modern applications. Spreadsheets provide a basic form of persistent storage but are limited in their ability to handle complex data relationships. Database management systems offer structured and efficient data storage, support for relationships, and features for data integrity and security. The choice of database model and the implementation of a DBMS require careful consideration based on the application's specific data structure and requirements.</p>"},{"location":"week4/Relations%20and%20ER%20Diagram/","title":"Relations and ER Diagram","text":""},{"location":"week4/Relations%20and%20ER%20Diagram/#relations-and-er-diagram","title":"Relations and ER Diagram","text":"<p>Summary Understanding Relationships in Data Modeling</p> <p>Introduction</p> <p>In data modeling, relationships play a crucial role in defining the structure and organization of data. They establish connections between entities, allowing data to be linked and organized in a meaningful way. Understanding the different types of relationships and their representations is essential for designing effective data models.</p> <p>Types of Relationships</p> <p>There are three primary types of relationships in data modeling:</p> <ul> <li>One-to-One: A relationship where each entity in one set is associated with at most one entity in the other set. For example, a student can have only one roll number, and a roll number identifies only one student.</li> <li>One-to-Many (Many-to-One): A relationship where each entity in one set is associated with one or more entities in the other set, but each entity in the other set is associated with at most one entity in the first set. For example, a student can stay in only one hostel, while a hostel can have many students.</li> <li>Many-to-Many: A relationship where each entity in one set can be associated with one or more entities in the other set, and each entity in the other set can be associated with one or more entities in the first set. For example, a student can register for multiple courses, and a course can have multiple students.</li> </ul> <p>Diagrammatic Representations</p> <p>Relationships in data modeling are often represented using diagrams, such as Entity-Relationship (ER) diagrams and Unified Modeling Language (UML) diagrams.</p> <p>Entity-Relationship Diagrams (ERDs)</p> <p>ERDs are graphical representations that show the entities in a system, their attributes, and the relationships between them. Entities are represented by rectangles, attributes are represented by ovals, and relationships are represented by lines. The cardinality of a relationship (one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-many) is indicated by symbols on the connecting lines.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>UML Diagrams</p> <p>UML diagrams use a more standardized notation to represent relationships. Class relationships are represented by lines with different types of arrowheads, where the type of arrowhead indicates the cardinality of the relationship.</p> <p>Additional Relationship Types</p> <p>In addition to the three primary types of relationships, there are several other variations, including:</p> <ul> <li>Self-referential relationships: Relationships where an entity can relate to itself. For example, a department can have a manager who is also an employee in the same department.</li> <li>Weak entities: Entities that require a relationship with another entity to exist. For example, a line item on an invoice cannot exist without an invoice.</li> <li>Ternary relationships: Relationships involving three entities. For example, a relationship between students, courses, and grades.</li> </ul> <p>Importance of Relationships in Data Modeling</p> <p>Relationships play a vital role in data modeling for several reasons:</p> <ul> <li>They define the structure and organization of data, enabling efficient data retrieval and manipulation.</li> <li>They ensure data consistency by maintaining constraints on the connections between entities.</li> <li>They facilitate data normalization, which reduces data redundancy and improves data integrity.</li> <li>They allow for the creation of complex data models that can accurately reflect real-world entities and their interactions.</li> </ul> <p>Conclusion</p> <p>Understanding relationships in data modeling is fundamental to designing effective and efficient data models. By comprehending the different types of relationships, their representations, and their importance, data architects and database designers can create data models that meet the requirements of their applications and provide a solid foundation for data-driven decisions.</p>"},{"location":"week4/sql/","title":"SQL","text":""},{"location":"week4/sql/#sql","title":"SQL","text":"<p>Summary Relational Databases</p> <p>Relational databases, developed by IBM in the 1970s, are a type of data storage organized in tabular format. They consist of tables, which have columns (fields) and rows (individual entries). Each table represents a specific entity or category of data, such as students, courses, or departments.</p> <p>Key Fields</p> <p>A key field is a unique identifier for each row in a table. The primary key is the most important key field, allowing for fast and efficient access to data, especially in large databases. Foreign keys, on the other hand, are used to establish relationships between different tables, linking related data.</p> <p>Queries</p> <p>Queries are used to retrieve data from a database based on specific criteria. They are written in a structured language called SQL (Structured Query Language), which uses English-like syntax but has a specific format. Queries can be used to find specific records, filter data based on conditions, or perform mathematical operations.</p> <p>Structured Query Language (SQL)</p> <p>SQL is a verbose language that enables users to interact with relational databases. Its syntax includes keywords, operators, and clauses that specify the desired data manipulation or retrieval operations. SQL consists of several specific types of operations, including:</p> <ul> <li>Select: Retrieves specific columns or rows from a table</li> <li>From: Specifies the table(s) to retrieve data from</li> <li>Where: Filters the data based on specified conditions</li> <li>Join: Combines data from multiple tables based on matching key fields</li> </ul> <p>Inner Join</p> <p>An inner join operation combines rows from two or more tables based on common key fields. It retrieves only the rows that match in both tables, resulting in a smaller dataset that contains only the relevant data.</p> <p>Cartesian Product</p> <p>A Cartesian product is a theoretical operation that combines all rows from two or more tables, resulting in a much larger dataset. However, in practice, it is uncommon to use Cartesian products due to the large number of unnecessary combinations.</p> <p>Query Example: Finding Students Enrolled in Calculus</p> <p>The following SQL query demonstrates how to find all students enrolled in a course named \"Calculus\":</p> <pre><code>SELECT s.name\nFROM Students s\nJOIN StudentsCourses sc ON s.IDNumber = sc.studentID\nJOIN Courses c ON c.ID = sc.courseID\nWHERE c.name = 'Calculus';\n</code></pre> <p>In this query:</p> <ul> <li>The SELECT clause specifies the column to be retrieved (student names).</li> <li>The FROM clause specifies the tables to be joined (Students, StudentsCourses, and Courses).</li> <li>The JOIN clauses specify how the tables are to be joined based on the IDNumber field (studentID and courseID).</li> <li>The WHERE clause filters the results to include only students enrolled in the \"Calculus\" course.</li> </ul> <p>Summary</p> <p>Relational databases provide a structured and efficient way to store and manage data in a tabular format. They use keys and relationships to organize and connect data. SQL is a specific language used to interact with relational databases, allowing users to retrieve and manipulate data based on specific criteria.</p>"},{"location":"week4/sql/#acid-properties","title":"ACID properties","text":"<p>ACID properties are a set of principles that ensure reliable processing of database transactions.
