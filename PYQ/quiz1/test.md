Analyzing DocumentsAnalyzing DocumentsThe provided Jinja2 template code processes a list of numbers and outputs a modified list. Let's break down how it works:

1. **Template Definition**:

   ```python
   from jinja2 import Template
   temp = """
   {% for num in seq|reject("even") %}
   {{ num+2 }}
   {% endfor %}
   """
   ```

   - This defines a Jinja2 template `temp` that iterates over a sequence `seq`.
   - The `reject("even")` filter is used to exclude even numbers from the sequence.
   - For each remaining number (`num`), it adds 2 and outputs the result.
2. **Sequence Definition**:

   ```python
   seq = [6, 5, 71, 13, 30, 22]
   ```

   - This defines the list `seq` with the numbers `[6, 5, 71, 13, 30, 22]`.
3. **Template Rendering**:

   ```python
   output = Template(temp)
   print(output.render(seq=seq))
   ```

   - This creates a `Template` object with the defined template `temp`.
   - The `render` method is called with `seq` as the argument, which processes the template with the provided sequence.

**Step-by-Step Execution**:

- The `reject("even")` filter removes the even numbers from `seq`. The even numbers in `seq` are `6, 30, 22`, so the remaining sequence is `[5, 71, 13]`.
- The template then iterates over the remaining numbers and adds 2 to each:
  - `5 + 2 = 7`
  - `71 + 2 = 73`
  - `13 + 2 = 15`

**Output**:
The final output of the template rendering will be:

```
7
73
15
```

So, the code processes the list by filtering out even numbers and then adding 2 to each of the remaining numbers, outputting the results.



Analyzing DocumentsThe `reject("even")` filter used in the provided Jinja2 template is not a built-in filter in Jinja2. Instead, it is part of the `jinja2.ext.do` extension, which provides additional filters and functions.

To use the `reject("even")` filter, you need to enable the `do` extension in your Jinja2 environment. Here is how you can do it:

```python
from jinja2 import Environment, Template

# Enable the 'do' extension
env = Environment(extensions=['jinja2.ext.do'])

# Define the template
temp = """
{% for num in seq|reject("even") %}
{{ num+2 }}
{% endfor %}
"""

# Create a Template object with the environment
template = env.from_string(temp)

# Define the sequence
seq = [6, 5, 71, 13, 30, 22]

# Render the template with the sequence
output = template.render(seq=seq)
print(output)
```

This code will correctly use the `reject("even")` filter to exclude even numbers from the sequence and then add 2 to each of the remaining numbers, producing the output:

```
7
73
15
```

If you do not enable the `do` extension, you will encounter an error because the `reject` filter will not be recognized.
