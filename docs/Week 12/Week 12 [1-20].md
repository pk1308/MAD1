**Summary**
**App Deployment**

**Components of an App**

An app consists of several components:

* **Code:** The source code that defines the app's functionality.
* **Configuration:** Settings that control the app's behavior.
* **Data:** The information stored and used by the app.
* **Dependencies:** Other software or services that the app relies on.

**Service Approaches**

There are three main service approaches for deploying apps:

* **Monolithic:** A single, all-in-one service that includes all the app's components.
* **Microservices:** Multiple, separate services, each responsible for a specific task or function.
* **Serverless:** No dedicated servers; the app's components run on-demand in the cloud.

**Automation and Containers**

* **Automation:** Using tools to automate tasks such as building, testing, and deploying apps.
* **Containers:** Lightweight, isolated environments that package all the dependencies and configuration needed to run an app.

**App Development**

**Developing an App**

App development typically involves the following steps:

* **Idea:** Conceptualizing the app's purpose and functionality.
* **Local Development:** Building and testing the app on a local computer. This includes:
    * Utilizing the file system for storing code and data.
    * Using editors and tools to write and manage code.
    * Running the app on a single computer.
* **Multiple Services:** In larger apps, deploying multiple services on separate servers, such as web servers and database servers.

**Permanent Deployment**

**Dedicated Servers**

* Using dedicated servers for permanent app deployment.
* These servers are always connected to the internet and have uninterrupted power.
* This infrastructure is often located in data centers or the cloud.

**Scaling**

* Scaling refers to adjusting the app's resources to meet increasing demand.
* This can involve adding or removing servers, modifying server configurations, or optimizing code.
