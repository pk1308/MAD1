# Backend Systems

**Summary**
**Backend Systems**

Backend systems, also known as server-side systems, play a crucial role in modern computing environments. They provide the infrastructure and services that support the front-end, user-facing applications and services. Backend systems handle data storage, processing, and management, ensuring the smooth functioning and scalability of the overall system.

**Memory Hierarchy**

The memory hierarchy refers to the different levels of storage devices used in a computer system. Each level has its own characteristics in terms of storage capacity, access speed, and cost. The hierarchy is designed to optimize system performance by placing frequently accessed data in faster, more expensive storage devices, while less frequently accessed data is stored in slower, less expensive devices.

**Types of Storage Elements**

The memory hierarchy consists of various types of storage elements, each with its own unique properties:

* **On-chip registers:** Registers are the fastest storage elements, located on the CPU chip itself. They hold small amounts of data (usually a few bytes) and are used to store frequently used variables and intermediate results during program execution.
* **SRAM (cache):** SRAM (static random-access memory) is a type of high-speed memory that is used as a cache to store frequently accessed data from the main memory. It is faster than DRAM but has a smaller capacity.
* **DRAM (dynamic random-access memory):** DRAM is the main memory of most computers. It provides high-capacity storage at a lower cost than SRAM. However, it is slower than SRAM and requires periodic refreshing to maintain its data.
* **Solid-state disk (SSD) - Flash:** SSDs are non-volatile storage devices that use flash memory to store data. They offer higher speeds and lower latencies than hard disk drives (HDDs).
* **Magnetic disk (HDD - hard disk drive):** HDDs are traditional mechanical storage devices that use spinning disks to store data. They have a large storage capacity and are less expensive than SSDs, but they are also slower.

**Storage Parameters**

When evaluating storage devices, several key parameters must be considered:

1. **Latency**:

   - **Definition**: Latency is the time it takes to read the first value from a storage location. Lower latency is better because it means data can be accessed more quickly.
   - **Comparison**:
     - Registers have the lowest latency.
     - Followed by SRAM (Static Random-Access Memory).
     - Then DRAM (Dynamic Random-Access Memory).
     - SSDs (Solid State Drives) have higher latency than DRAM.
     - HDDs (Hard Disk Drives) have the highest latency among the listed storage types.
2. **Throughput**:

   - **Definition**: Throughput is the number of bytes per second that can be read from the storage. Higher throughput is better because it means more data can be read in a given amount of time.
   - **Comparison**:
     - DRAM has the highest throughput.
     - Followed by SSDs.
     - HDDs have lower throughput compared to SSDs and DRAM.
     - Registers and SRAM are not included in the throughput comparison due to their limited capacity.
3. **Density**:

   - **Definition**: Density refers to the number of bits that can be stored per unit area or cost. Higher density is better because it means more data can be stored in a smaller space or at a lower cost.
   - **Comparison**:
     - HDDs have the highest density.
     - Followed by SSDs.
     - Then DRAM.
     - SRAM has lower density than DRAM.
     - Registers have the lowest density.

In summary, registers and SRAM are very fast but have limited capacity and lower density. DRAM offers a good balance of speed and capacity. SSDs provide high throughput and density but with higher latency compared to DRAM. HDDs offer the highest density but have the highest latency and lower throughput

**Computer Organization**

Modern computers are organized according to a hierarchical memory system that leverages the different storage elements mentioned above. The CPU (central processing unit) has a limited number of registers that hold the most frequently used data and instructions. These registers are backed by caches (L1, L2, L3), which are smaller, faster memory devices that store data that is likely to be accessed soon. The caches are further backed by the main memory (DRAM), which provides larger capacity for storing data and instructions that are not currently in use. Finally, the main memory is backed by secondary storage devices such as SSDs and HDDs, which provide even larger capacities for long-term data storage.

**Cold Storage**

Cold storage refers to long-term storage options for large amounts of data that are not frequently accessed. These storage options typically have high latency but low cost. Examples of cold storage include Amazon Glacier, Google Cloud Storage Coldline, and Microsoft Azure Archive Storage.

**Impact on Application Development**

Understanding the storage hierarchy and the characteristics of different storage elements is critical for application developers. The choice of storage technology can significantly impact the speed and efficiency of an application. Developers must consider the access patterns, data size, and performance requirements of their applications to select the appropriate storage solutions.
