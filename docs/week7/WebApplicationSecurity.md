# Web Application Security

1. **SQL Injection**

   - **Description**: SQL injection is a code injection technique that exploits a security vulnerability in an application's software by manipulating SQL queries.
   - **Mitigation**:
     - **Use known frameworks**: Employing well-established frameworks that have built-in protections against SQL injection.
     - **Best practices**: Following industry best practices for secure coding.
     - **Validation**: Validating and sanitizing all user inputs to ensure they do not contain malicious SQL code.
2. **Buffer Overflows, Input Overflows**

   - **Description**: Buffer overflow occurs when more data is written to a buffer than it can hold, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution. Input overflow is a broader term that includes any input exceeding expected limits.
   - **Mitigation**:
     - **Length of inputs, queries**: Limiting the length of inputs and queries to prevent overflow conditions.
3. **Server Level Issues - Protocol Implementation**

   - **Description**: Server-level issues can arise from improper implementation of protocols, leading to vulnerabilities.
   - **Mitigation**:
     - **Use known servers with good track record of security**: Choosing servers that are well-regarded for their security features.
     - **Update all patches**: Regularly updating server software to apply security patches and fixes.
4. **Possible Outcomes of Security Breaches**

   - **Loss of data - deletion**: Unauthorized deletion of data, leading to data loss.
   - **Exposure of data - sensitive information leak**: Unauthorized access and exposure of sensitive information.
   - **Manipulation of data - change**: Unauthorized changes to data, which can compromise data integrity.

In summary, the image emphasizes the importance of using secure frameworks, validating inputs, maintaining server security, and understanding the potential consequences of security breaches to protect web applications from common vulnerabilities.
