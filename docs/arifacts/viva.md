**Summary**
**db.Model vs db.Table:**

- db.Model: For data models with associated methods.
- db.Table: For table structures without additional features.

**HTTP Methods:**

- GET: Retrieve a resource.
- POST: Create a new resource.
- PUT: Update an existing resource.
- DELETE: Remove a resource.
- PATCH: Update a portion of a resource.

**MVC Architecture:**

- Model: Handles data and logic.
- View: Displays data to the user.
- Controller: Manages user input and updates the Model and View.

**Relationships in Databases:**

- Define how data in different tables is related.
- Types: One-to-One, One-to-Many, Many-to-Many.

**Normalization:**

- Organizes data to reduce redundancy and dependence.
- Levels: First, Second, Third.

**ACID vs BASE:**

- ACID: Guarantees transactions are atomic, consistent, isolated, and durable.
- BASE: Emphasizes availability, soft state, and eventual consistency.

**Primary Key and Unique Key:**

- Primary Key: Uniquely identifies each record in a table and cannot contain null values.
- Unique Key: Ensures uniqueness but allows one null value.

**Exception Handling:**

- try: Contains code that may raise an exception.
- except: Catches and handles specific exceptions.
- finally: Code that will execute regardless of whether an exception occurred.

**Error Handler:**

- Used to handle errors in a web application.
- Maps specific HTTP status codes to appropriate error messages and actions.

**Cluster:**

- A method of organizing or storing data to improve performance.
- Types: Index clusters (optimize query performance) and table clusters (store related data together).

**Authentication vs Authorization:**

- Authentication: Verifying the identity of a user or system.
- Authorization: Determining what actions or resources an authenticated entity can access.

**Cell Padding and Cell Spacing:**

- Cell Padding: Space between text and cell itself.
- Cell Spacing: Space between cells.

**Rest API and its Methods:**

- RESTful API: An architectural style for designing networked applications.
- Methods: GET (fetch data), POST (submit data), PUT (update/create data), DELETE (remove data), PATCH (make a small update)

**SQLAlchemy:**

- A Python library that simplifies database interactions using an Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) system.
- Provides classes that mirror database tables, making database operations more Pythonic.

**ORM:**

- Object-Relational Mapping allows you to interact with a database using objects in your programming language.
- Simplifies database interactions by representing tables as classes and rows as instances of those classes.

**Controller Sends and Receives API:**

- The controller in a web application handles HTTP requests and sends and receives API data.
- Requests are processed, and appropriate responses are sent using libraries like 'requests'.
- The controller interacts with databases and business logic to handle API interactions.

**@app.route():**

- A Flask decorator used to associate a function with a URL route.
- Informs Flask which function to execute when a particular URL is accessed.

**Template Inheritance:**

- Allows you to create a base or parent template with a common structure.
- Other templates can then inherit from this base template and customize specific content sections.

**Lazy Loading:**

- A technique where resources or data are loaded only when needed, improving the initial page load time.
- Commonly used with images, scripts, or other assets on a webpage.

**Single Page Application (SPA):**

- A web application where the initial page load contains all necessary content, and subsequent interactions dynamically update the page without requiring full page reloads.
- Provides a more responsive and interactive user experience.

**Flask:**

- A lightweight and flexible web framework for Python.
- Provides a simple and extensible platform for building web applications.

**2-Tier vs 3-Tier Architecture:**

- 2-Tier: Client-server model with direct communication between client and server.
- 3-Tier: Introduces an application layer between client and server, providing an additional layer of business logic and improved scalability.

**Static vs Dynamic Pages:**

- Static Pages: Content is pre-generated and remains unchanged unless manually modified.
- Dynamic Pages: Content is generated on-demand based on user interactions or data from databases.

**Types of Testing:**

- Unit Testing: Testing individual components of software.
- White Box Testing: Examining the internal structure of software.
- Black Box Testing: Testing software functionality without knowing its internal code.
- Integrated Testing: Verifying interactions between integrated components or systems.

**List vs Tuple vs Dictionary:**

- List: Mutable sequence of elements.
- Tuple: Immutable sequence of elements.
- Dictionary: Collection of key-value pairs.

**Primary Keys:**

- Unique identifiers assigned to each record in a table.
- Ensure data integrity, efficient data retrieval, and relationships between tables.

**Bootstrap:**

- A front-end framework providing pre-designed and reusable components for creating visually appealing and mobile-friendly user interfaces.

**Indexing:**

- A technique that enhances the speed of data retrieval operations by creating data structures (indexes) to quickly locate and access specific records.

**Git:**

- A distributed version control system that enables collaboration, history tracking, and version control in software development.

**Built-in HTML5 Form Controls:**

- Provide partial validation, such as required fields, minimum or maximum values, and custom patterns.

**Sandboxing:**

- A secure area provided by JavaScript engines to run code without accessing local files or network resources.
