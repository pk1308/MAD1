### REST (REpresentational State Transfer)

- REST is a software architecture style for distributed systems on the web.
- REST defines a set of constraints that guide the design of web services.
- REST is based on the idea of representing state in the form of resources that are transferred between clients and servers.

### REST Sequence

- **Client accesses a Resource Identifier from server:** Typically a URI (Uniform Resource Identifier).
- **Resource Operation specified as part of access:** E.g., GET, POST, PUT, DELETE.
- **Server responds with new Resource Identifier:** New state of system and links to follow.

### Using HTTP with REST

- HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is a protocol that can be used to carry REST messages.
- HTTP verbs (e.g., GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) are used to indicate actions.
- HTTP provides standardized functionality.

### Using JSON with REST

- JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a data format that is commonly used with REST APIs.
- JSON is a lightweight and easy-to-read format that can represent complex data structures.

### API Data Transfer Format

- **Input to API:** Text (e.g., HTTP)
- **Output:** Complex data types (e.g., JSON, XML)
- **Different from internal server representation**
- **Different from final view presentation**
