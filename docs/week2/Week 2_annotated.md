**Summary**
**Information Representation**

Computers work only with binary digits (bits). They can represent:

* **Numbers**: Using place value
* **Letters**: Using character encoding

**Character Encoding**

Character encoding translates characters into sequences of bits. Common encodings include:

* **ASCII**: 7-bit encoding for English characters and common symbols
* **Unicode**: Universal Character Set encoding that supports a vast range of characters from different languages
* **UTF-8**: Variable-length encoding that is efficient for most languages

**Markup**

Markup languages add meaning and structure to text without directly formatting it. Types of markup include:

* **Presentational**: Dictates how content should appear (e.g., WYSIWYG editors)
* **Procedural**: Provides instructions for display (e.g., changing font size)
* **Descriptive**: Defines the semantic structure of content (e.g., headings, paragraphs)

**HTML (HyperText Markup Language)**

HTML is a semantic markup language used for creating web pages. It uses tags to structure and format content. Examples:

* `<html>`: Defines the start of an HTML document
* `<body>`: Encloses the main content of the page
* `<h1>`: Defines a heading

**Document Object Model (DOM)**

The DOM is a tree structure that represents the logical layout of an HTML document. It allows direct manipulation of the document's elements.

**Styling**

Styling defines the appearance of content. CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to separate styling information from markup. It allows for multiple definitions, with the latest definition taking precedence.

**Types of Styling**

* **Inline CSS**: Styles added directly to tags
* **Internal CSS**: Styles defined within the `<head>` tag
* **External CSS**: Styles defined in separate files

**Responsive Design**

CSS can be used to adapt the layout of a web page to different screen sizes, making it mobile and tablet-friendly.

**Bootstrap**

Bootstrap is a popular framework that provides pre-defined styles for common components (e.g., buttons, forms) and promotes mobile-first design.

**Javascript**

Javascript is an interpreted language used to add programmability to web browsers. It is not related to Java.
