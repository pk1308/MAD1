**Summary**
**Information Representation**

* Computers process only binary digits (bits) as 0s and 1s.
* Numbers are represented using place value or two's complement for negative values.
* Text characters are represented as bit sequences.

**Character Encodings**

* ASCII: 7-bit encoding for basic English characters.
* Unicode: Expanded encoding for various languages and symbols.
* UTF-8: Variable-length encoding based on Unicode, efficient for most common languages.

**Markup**

* Markup distinguishes content from meaning.
* Presentational markup focuses on styling (e.g., **bold**, <font>).
* Procedural markup provides instructions for display (e.g., change font size).
* Descriptive markup indicates structural elements (e.g., <title>, <heading>).

**HTML**

* HyperText Markup Language used for web documents.
* Tags indicate document structure and content (e.g., <html>, <h1>).
* HTML5 introduces new elements and multimedia support.
* Document Object Model (DOM) represents the logical structure of an HTML document.

**Styling**

* CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) separates presentation from content.
* CSS rules can be embedded within HTML, defined internally within a <style> element, or loaded externally from a separate file.
* CSS allows for multiple definitions, with the most recent taking precedence.
* Responsive design adjusts styling based on device screen size.
