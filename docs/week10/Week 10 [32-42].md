**Summary**
## Test Generation Techniques

### API-based Testing

**Application Programming Interface (API)**

* An abstraction for system design that defines how data and services are shared between applications.
* Standard representations exist for APIs: OpenAPI, Swagger, etc.

**API-based Test Generation**

* Can generate test cases using API definition imported from standards like OpenAPI.
* Tests can be generated for specific endpoints, scenarios, and data validation.
* Possible problem cases can be injected based on known techniques.
* API traffic can be recorded and analyzed for testing purposes.

### Abstract Tests

**Semi-formal Verbal Description**

* Tests are described in a semi-formal verbal language.
* Example: "Make a request to '/' endpoint and ensure the result contains the text 'Hello world'."

**Executable Tests**

* Abstract tests are converted into executable tests by replacing verbal language with specific programming constructs.
* Example Python test for the above semi-formal description:
```python
def test_hello(client):
    """Verify home page."""
    rv = client.get('/')
    assert b'Hello world' in rv.data
```

### Model-based Testing

**System Model**

* A model of the system under test is created, comprising:
    * Possible states (e.g., logged in, password reset)
    * Possible transitions between states

**Test Generation**

* Scenarios are defined based on the system model.
* Tests are generated for the possible transitions between states.
* Example: Authenticate user before showing information:
    * Scenarios:
        * User already logged in - page shown
        * User not yet logged in - redirect to login page
        * Forgot password - after resetting, come back to desired page
    * Model:
        * Possible states (logged in, password reset, ...)
        * Possible transitions
    * Tests:
        * Generated for each possible transition

### Models and Abstract Tests

* Abstract tests apply to generic models.
* Executable tests are derived by combining abstract test information with the specific model of the system under test.

### (G)UI Testing

**GUI (Graphical User Interface)**

* The visual output of a system.
* Most systems, even web-based ones, present a GUI.

**GUI Testing**

* Tests whether specific elements are present on a page.
* Verifies navigation links.
* Evaluates the system's behavior when random page elements are clicked.

### Browser Automation

**Browser Automation Tools**

* Used to automate tests that cannot be run programmatically through direct requests.
* Example: Selenium framework - instantiates an actual browser.
* Other tools: Python requests library, Capybara (Ruby), ...

**Capabilities**

* Web page rendering and navigation simulation.
* Element interaction and verification.
* Captcha and user input handling in certain cases.

### Security Testing

**Techniques**

* Generates invalid inputs to test app behavior.
* Attempts to crash the server through overload, injection, etc.
* Black-box or White-box approaches:
    * Black-box: Tests based on external behavior without knowledge of internal implementation.
    * White-box: Tests based on internal structure and implementation details.

**Fuzzing**

* Generates large numbers of random or semi-random inputs to test system resilience.
