**Summary**
**Browsers and Clients**

**Minimal Requirements for Browsers and Clients**

To qualify as a browser or client, a software program must meet the following minimal requirements:

* **Render (display) HTML:** The browser or client must be able to interpret and display Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) code, the primary language used to create web pages.
* **Cookie interaction:** The browser or client must be able to accept and return cookies from the server to enable user sessions and maintain state information.

**Text-Mode Browsers and Accessibility**

Text-mode browsers, such as Lynx and Elinks, are relatively simple browsers that display text-only content. They do not render images or apply complex styling, making them suitable for users with limited bandwidth or older devices.

Accessibility guidelines recommend that web pages should not rely on colors or font sizes/styles to convey meaning. Instead, they should use alternative methods, such as semantic HTML tags and aria attributes, to make content accessible to users with disabilities.

**Page Styling and Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)**

CSS is the primary language used to style web pages. It allows developers to specify the appearance of elements on a page, including fonts, colors, and layout. While CSS is not strictly necessary for a browser to function, it has become an essential part of modern web design.

**Interactivity and JavaScript**

To enable user interaction on web pages, most browsers support client-side programming languages, with JavaScript being the most popular. JavaScript allows developers to manipulate HTML elements, respond to user input, and create more complex and dynamic web applications.

**JavaScript Engines**

Different browsers use different JavaScript engines to execute JavaScript code. The most common JavaScript engines include:

* V8 (used by Chrome, Chromium, Brave, and Edge)
* SpiderMonkey (used by Firefox)
* JavaScriptCore (used by Safari)

The performance of JavaScript code can vary depending on the browser and the choice of JavaScript engine. However, standardization efforts have minimized differences among engines.

**Client Load and Performance**

JavaScript engines can consume significant client CPU power, especially when handling complex page layouts or extensive graphics. Browsers can also utilize the GPU to handle graphics rendering, but this can also lead to increased CPU load if not managed efficiently.

**Machine Clients**

In addition to human users, machine clients, such as embedded devices and sensors, can also interact with web servers through APIs (Application Programming Interfaces). These clients typically do not support JavaScript and rely on HTTP endpoints for communication.

**Alternative Scripting Languages**

While JavaScript is the dominant scripting language for web browsers, alternative languages such as Python and WASM (WebAssembly) have emerged. However, these alternatives require transpilation or compilation to run on browsers, limiting their widespread adoption.

**WebAssembly (WASM)**

WASM is a binary instruction format designed for high-performance execution on the web. It targets a stack-based virtual machine and provides controlled access to APIs. WASM can be used to compile languages like C and C++ to run efficiently within browsers.

**Emscripten**

Emscripten is a compiler framework that allows developers to compile C or C++ code to WASM. This opens up possibilities for creating high-performance applications that run directly in the browser.

**Native Mode**

Browsers can expose additional platform-specific functionality to web applications through native mode APIs. This includes access to the file system, phone, SMS, camera object detection, and web payments. However, enabling native mode introduces additional security considerations.
