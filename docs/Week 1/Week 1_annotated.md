**Summary**
**Apps**

- Software that runs on mobile devices, typically specific and compact.
- Originally referred to desktop or mobile applications, but now focuses on small, downloadable programs.

**Desktop Apps**

- Standalone, often offline
- Use local data storage
- Specific frameworks for each OS

**Mobile Apps**

- Designed for mobile platforms (phones/tablets)
- Limited screen space, touch interaction
- Frameworks vary by OS and platform
- Network-oriented

**Web Apps**

- Platform-independent
- Work across devices and OS

**Components of Applications**

- Storage: Where data is stored
- Computation: Indexing, searching, etc.
- Presentation: Displaying content

**Platforms**

- Desktop, mobile, web-based, embedded
- Platform features vary (e.g., keyboard/mouse, touchscreen, etc.)

**Architectures**

- Client-Server: Explicit server and client
- Distributed (Peer-to-Peer): All peers are considered equal

**Client-Server Model**

- Explicit differentiation between clients and servers
- May have local clients on same machine
- Variants include multiple servers, load balancing, etc.

**Distributed (Peer-to-Peer) Model**

- All peers are equal
- Error tolerance and shared information

**Software Architecture Patterns**

- MVC (Model-View-Controller): Core data, user interface, and business logic
- MVA, MVP, HMVC, MVVM, etc.

**Focus of the Course**

- Platform: Web-based
- Architecture: Client-server
- Software architecture: Model-View-Controller
- Building apps that use web-based servers and hypertext markup for display

**The Web**

- Platform choice for the course
- Generic, cross-platform, and worth understanding
- Constraints and costs to consider

**Historical Background of the Web**

- Telephone networks (circuit switching)
- Packet switched networks
- ARPANet, Ethernet, etc.
- Protocols and inter-network communication
- IP and TCP
- Domain names, hypertext, and the World Wide Web

**Web 2.0**

- Dynamic pages, HTTP transport mechanism, client-side computation
- Platform agnostic operating system

**Performance of Web Apps**

- Latency and response size impact performance
- Server resources, storage requirements, and client compute resources also affect speed

**Web Servers**

- Any computer with a network connection
- Listen for incoming requests and respond accordingly
- Follow specific protocols

**HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol)**

- Text-based protocol for client requests and server responses
- Specifies request types (GET, POST, PUT, etc.)
- Headers convey request information and server capabilities

**Protocol**

- Defines communication methods between server and client
- HTTP specifies request types, headers, and response formats

**Use Cases of HTTP**

- GET: Simple requests
- POST: Complex form data, file uploads
- PUT/DELETE: Extensively used in Web 2.0 and APIs

**Memory and Storage Requirements**

- Server processes can require significant memory for concurrent requests
- Search engines like Google may need massive data storage for indexing and cross-referencing web pages
