**Summary**
**Persistent Storage**

Persistent data storage is necessary to retain information beyond server resets or shutdowns. It involves organizing data into tables with columns and rows, enabling row-based operations.

**Storage Mechanisms**

- In-memory data structures: Prone to errors and scalability issues.
- Keys: Improve data entry accuracy and prevent duplicate entries.
- Objects: Allow for automatic ID generation and easy attribute access.
- Pickle, CSV, TSV: Limited flexibility and store data in essentially spreadsheet-like formats.
- Spreadsheets: Suitable for tabular data, but have challenges with lookups and stored procedures.
- Relational Databases (SQL): Store data in tabular format with columns and rows.
- Unstructured Databases (NoSQL): Flexible but may lack validation features.

**Relationships**

Relationships between entities can be one-to-one, one-to-many (or many-to-one), or many-to-many.

**Data Representation**

Diagrams (e.g., Entity-Relationship, UML) and class relations can be used to illustrate relationships.

**SQL (Structured Query Language)**

SQL is used for querying and manipulating data in relational databases. It employs English-like syntax but is structured and allows for mathematical operations (e.g., joins).

**Examples**

- Inner join: Retrieve data from multiple tables based on common attributes.
- Cartesian product: Combines all rows from two tables, creating many combinations.
- Complex SQL queries: Used to perform advanced data filtering and retrieval.
