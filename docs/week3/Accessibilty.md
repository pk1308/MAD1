# Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI)

The W3C Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) outlines several core principles to make web content accessible to people with disabilities. These principles are encapsulated in guidelines such as the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG), the Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines (ATAG), and the User Agent Accessibility Guidelines (UAAG). Here are some key aspects:

1. **Perceivable Information and User Interface**:

   - **Text Alternatives**: Provide text alternatives for non-text content (e.g., images, icons, and multimedia). These text alternatives enable content to be rendered in various forms, such as large print, braille, speech, symbols, or simpler language【7†source】.
   - **Captions and Audio Descriptions**: Offer captions for videos and audio descriptions for visual content, ensuring that users who cannot see or hear the media can still understand the content【7†source】.
2. **Operable User Interface and Navigation**:

   - **Keyboard Accessibility**: Ensure that all functionality is available from a keyboard. This is crucial for users who cannot use a mouse and rely on keyboard navigation.
   - **Enough Time**: Provide users enough time to read and use content. This includes mechanisms to extend time limits on activities.
3. **Understandable Information and User Interface**:

   - **Readable Content**: Make text readable and understandable. This includes providing clear instructions and using simple language where possible.
   - **Predictable Web Pages**: Ensure that web pages operate in predictable ways. For example, navigation mechanisms should be consistent throughout the site【7†source】.
4. **Robust Content and Reliable Interpretation**:

   - **Compatibility**: Content must be robust enough to be interpreted reliably by a wide variety of user agents, including assistive technologies. This involves following web standards and ensuring that content is compatible with current and future technologies.
